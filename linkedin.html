                    <p class="lead">
                        The first page of Pricerunner was a great page with very few faults according to the IA books. However I choose to look further into their Sale page, which doesn't really live up to the same standard as the main page. My solution to this was to take the category system on their main page that was very good and integrate it with the one on the sale page. The search bar doesn't really help you navigate on the sale part so I added a search bar for the sale page.

                    <p class="lead"> I have used pricerunner before so I started my research by getting someone who has never used it to use it, to see where things went wrong. It was mainly the sale page where things went wrong and they couldn't really find things. It gave me good information and I started to analyze and compare it to the books in the course. The big part that was really not working was the category system on the sale page. it was all over it could be a very specific item like toothbrushes but if you wanted socks it was in underwear. </p>

                    <p class="lead">The conclusion I got from it was that it's not bad but with a few changes it can become much better. They had a very amazing category system which was very hard to go wrong in, versus a system in the sale that was just so bare that it was hard to find the product you want on sale. I intergrated the category system from the front page to the sale which you can see in the wireframe. I also made a search bar that feels more connected to the sale part so users could easily understand which search bar to use.</p>
