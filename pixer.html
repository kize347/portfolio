                    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Summary </h2>
                    <p class="lead">Pixer was a very interesting project to do since it's really going against the standards of how the dating world works right now. My solution to the matching was to match them based on interests, while you see the pixelated face of the person you matched with it only gets unpixelated if you talk to the person. So it's more based around forming real connections and taking the time. But it's hard to justify doing this in reality as we are moving more and more towards instant gratification. </p>

                    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Research</h2>
                    <p class="lead">The research for Pixer was a lot of fun because I had never used a dating app before, so I had to do a lot of research for this project. I started off by talking to people who have been/are in the dating scene. The idea behind it to match with interest rather than how a person looks was hard and not well received by the users i talked to.  Then I moved on to doing research on how dating applications look and work. </p>

                    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Conclussion</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Light mode was superior but I don’t think you should ignore dark mode in today’s age so I made both light and dark versions that you could switch between. Since the users couldn't really let go of not seeing the person you're matching with, I pixelated the pictures that ur matching with to get a hint of what the person could look like. But even then there were very few people who would want to use my product. so in conclusion it might not be the best way, if you want to do a dating app in how the dating scene works right now.
